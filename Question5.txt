Q.5
They use different branches so they will not have conflicts when push to remote repo. In this way, they may resolve pull requests since they do not need to merge together. However, they can only work on their individual part and this may influence their shareing work. For the contribution, I think it is highly evaluated in github since we can see our contributions from graphs and get clearly undersatnding of how much each person contributed. It's convenient for people to collabarate and control versions. Also, it's easily for people to check whether a repo is forked or not and fork other's repo. In all, Github is a good open resouce and working tool for people.
